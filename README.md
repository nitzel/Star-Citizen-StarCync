# starCync
Source for chrome extension: Star Citizen : StarCync

The org follow script was passed around the community. From what I know the original is to be credited to nitzel (https://gist.github.com/nitzel/590a97ecbdb2c8256fff). Edits were made in order to work as an extension & pop the clan SID from the URL + make sure you were logged in.

Feel free to do what you like with this - edit it, add functionality, etc. Just trying to make it easier for people to manage their contact lists and keep them up to date with their org member lists.

Thanks!
