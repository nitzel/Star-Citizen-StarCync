# Star-Citizen-StarCync
Google chrome extension - Star Citizen : StarCync


StarCync: Add members of a Star Citizen org to your contact list. Manage contacts & sync to chrome sync for fast management.
Features:
Follow or Unfollow an Org*
Bulk Add/Remove via input field
Backup Contacts to or Restore from text file
Backup/Restore to Google Chrome Sync
Erase all RSI Contacts

First iteration of custom lists for Orgs with members over 250. By contacting me I can setup a list of active members that are pulled and added. This is good if you want only higher staff added when a member clicks the follow org button.

More to come!

*Please note: RSI limits your contact list to 250 members. A popup dialog will display if you've reached the limit.

*Note: Due to the way this extension launches (in a popup window) it must have access to all tabs.  You can use source viewers obtained via the google store or visit the above github link to checkout the source code.

Thank you!
